## Don't Panic!

Everyone experiences times of anxiety in their life. The question is not “if,” but “when” and “how bad?” Severe anxiety can lead to panic attacks, which involve a variety of distressing physical symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, and dizziness[1]. There are many resources to help mitigate the frequency and severity of panic attacks, but very little has been specifically designed to help in the middle of an attack. Unless friends or family are nearby, the person having a panic attack is left to deal with it alone.

*Don't Panic!* seeks to meet this need. It will be a free mobile application that provides the user with a handful of customizable and accessibly designed exercises that can be launched during a panic attack to help the user get through it.

## The Team

*Don't Panic!* is being developed by Michaelted Acosta, Diana Balderas, Stephen Christian Carlos, and Marcus Schmidt.
